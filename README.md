# Advent of Code 2023

My take on 2023’s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

# Learnings

- Day 1: I’ve learned about lookarounds (also known as positive- and negative-lookaheads and lookbehinds) in regexes !
- Day 2: A good focus my data structures made the implementation really simple ! Also, I've learned about `math.prod`, and about the `--root` option in Git to modify the very first commit of a repo.
- Day 3: Using slices and the fact that indices are not "symmetric": the beginning is included in the slice, the end is not. Stripping the EOL from the output of `readlines()` is a good practice.
